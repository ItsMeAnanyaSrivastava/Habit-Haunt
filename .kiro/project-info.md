## 📋 Project Details

**Project Name**: Habit Haunt

## 🎯 Project Description

**Habit Haunt** is a Halloween-themed web application that gamifies the process of breaking bad habits by transforming them into horror monsters. Users battle their personal demons through daily tasks and rituals, tracking progress on a haunted forest path while viewing spooky analytics.

### The Concept

Breaking bad habits is genuinely scary - it's a battle against invisible forces that feel monstrous and overwhelming. Habit Haunt makes this abstract psychological struggle tangible and engaging by:

1. **Visualizing habits as monsters** - Your procrastination becomes a demon you can see
2. **Gamifying progress** - Each completed task damages the monster
3. **Tracking the journey** - A haunted path shows victories and failures
4. **Providing feedback** - Spooky analytics display your progress

## 🚀 Key Innovation

### What Makes It Unique

- **Horror as Motivation**: Uses fear aesthetics to represent the real fear of habits
- **Visual Progress**: Abstract concepts become concrete, trackable elements
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time HP reduction shows impact of actions
- **Emotional Connection**: Personal monster creates investment in the battle
